    <h1>
      The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter-And How to Make the Most of
      Them Now by Meg Jay
    </h1>
    <h2>The Biggest Takeaways:</h2>
    <p class="book-cover">
      This is a perfect book for all people in their twenties who feel a bit
      lost or find this age confusing. The time has changed dramatically over a
      couple of decades and lives in our twenties are very different compared to
      a couple of decades back. Nevertheless, how confusing or different it is
      we have to take control of our lives and not to waste one of our most
      productive age.
      <br /><br />
      There may be parts people can disagree, but I think we should at least
      think about them more.
      <br /><br />
      The future isn't written in the stars. There are no guarantees. So claim
      your adulthood. Be intentional, get to work, pick your family, do the math
      and make your own certainty. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or
      didn't do. You are deciding your life right now.
      <br /><br />
      Likewise, in the twentysomething years, even a small shift can radically
      change where we end up in our thirties and beyond. The twenties are an
      up-in-the-air and turbulent time, but if we can figure out how to
      navigate, even a little bit at a time, we can get further, faster, than at
      any other stage in life. It is a pivotal time when the things we do—and
      the things we don’t do—will have an enormous effect across years and even
      generations to come. So let’s get going. The time is now.
    </p>
    <h3>Building Identity Capital:</h3>
    <p>
      It is quite logical that we should not waste our time and that we should
      be working on ourself, and still, most people in their twenties live like
      they will be in their twenties forever. I am not saying it is wrong but if
      we are only enjoying and having fun without building our "Identity
      Capital" we may realize in our late twenties or thirties that we are not
      ready for this age.
      <br /><br />
      As Meg Jay says, Identity capital is our collection of personal assets. It
      is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time.
      These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well
      enough, or long enough, that they become a part of who we are. Identity
      capital is how we build ourselves—bit by bit, over time. Most important,
      identity capital is what we bring to the adult marketplace. So do not
      waste your time and build your identity capital.
    </p>
    <h3>The Strength of Weak Ties:</h3>
    <p>
      In our lives we have people who are very close to us and to which we
      communicate almost on a daily basis, and we know those people very well,
      those are "strong ties". On the other hand, there are people we met once
      or a couple of times, people we know or knew, but we do not have such
      close contact, those are "weak ties". It can be your past colleagues,
      bosses, teachers, someone you met at a conference...
      <br /><br />
      I never thought about those relationships, as Meg Jay described it. Weak
      ties can be significant when it comes to searching for a new job, getting
      a new opportunity, helping with business ... Strong ties can do the same,
      but with weak ties come entirely new opportunities as we do not know those
      people very well, and they may have very different connections than our
      strong ties.
    </p>
    <h3>The Unthought Known:</h3>
    <p>
      There are things we know about ourself, but we kind of forgot about them.
      It can be some skills or dreams. We may have forgotten them due to our
      business or maybe due to fear. We should slow down and remind ourself
      about those things. Slow down and maybe try them again while we still have
      the time.
    </p>
    <h3>Do Not Compare Yourself:</h3>
    <p>
      In today's age, with all the social media, we tend to compare ourself with
      others. It may be useful to some extent, but most of us are going way
      beyond the healthy level. People often/most of the time put on social
      media only the good things which are looking better than the reality. We
      then become depressed that all of our friends on social media are having a
      fantastic life, although the opposite is true. Everybody is struggling and
      fighting its way through life, but we will not put this on social media.
      The advice here is to watch social media less often and be mindful what is
      behind each picture/story.
      <br /><br />
      If we only wanted to be happy, it would be easy; but we want to be happier
      than other people, which is almost always difficult since we think them
      happier than they are. —Charles de Montesquieu, writer/philosopher.
    </p>
    <h3>The Customized Life:</h3>
    <p>
      With the vast pool of opportunities, one can get lost. We may also get
      unhappy with our lives at some point. But it is all in our hands, and we
      can build our own customized life. We just have to start somewhere. If we
      do only the easy things, we should not expect big rewards. I personally
      have high standards, and I know by doing easy things, I will not get where
      I want to be. This may seem like always chasing something in the future,
      but it is more important to enjoy the process of getting somewhere;
      otherwise we may just get stuck in the future.
    </p>
    <h3>Love/Relationships:</h3>
    <p>
      The older we get, the bigger the pressure we may feel towards being in a
      relationship. We should start thinking about building a relationship or
      finding the right partner a bit earlier than in our thirties, this, of
      course, does not apply to everyone. There may be people that are not
      interested in anything serious, but for most of us do not want to stay
      alone, and we want to build a family. The older we get, the harder it may
      be to establish a relationship as we will get used to our way of life.
      Once we have a partner, we need to compromise a lot, but once we get
      older, it is harder to change our way of living.
      <br /><br />
      This may seem like we should find someone as soon as possible, but we
      should also be cautious who we are going to be with. A relationship is a
      commitment, and we should take it seriously.
      <br /><br />
      Older spouses may be more mature, but later marriage has its challenges.
      Rather than growing together while their twentysomething selves are still
      forming, partners who marry older may be more set in their ways. And a
      series of low-commitment, possibly destructive relationships, can create
      bad habits and erode faith in love. And even though searching may help you
      find a better partner, the pool of available singles shallows over time,
      perhaps in more ways than one.
      <br /><br />
      Outside of work, commitments to others also foster change and well-being.
      Studies in the United States and Europe have found that entering into
      stable relationships helps twentysomethings feel more secure and
      responsible, whether these relationships last or not. Steady relationships
      reduce social anxiety and depression as they help us feel less lonely and
      allow us to practice our interpersonal skills. We learn about managing our
      emotions and conflict resolution. As we take part in partnering, we find
      new ways to feel competent in the adult world.
    </p>
    <h3>The Cohabitation Effect:</h3>
    <p>
      A lot of people, when they are in a relationship for some time, move
      together. One of the biggest reason is to test if things will work out
      before marrying each other.
      <br /><br />
      Couples who live together before marriage tend to be less satisfied with
      the marriage, and more likely to divorce.
      <br /><br />
      It happens from "sliding not deciding," slipping into living together out
      of convenience, then eventually deciding to get married. But your criteria
      for cohabitation will be lower than marriage so that you can end up in a
      suboptimal marriage.
      <br /><br />
      Living together can lead to “lock-in” where it’s too hard to break up,
      despite a bad relationship, so you don’t.
      <br /><br />
      Meg Jay's advice is to try out the relationship in different ways before
      moving out together or getting married. It can be travelling in third
      world countries together where you need to rely on each other or to try
      different activities. This often tests the relationship more than moving
      together.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Brain:</h3>
    <p>
      For me, this is the most exciting part of the book. We have many stages
      when our brain is developing the most, but the lates stage, when our brain
      is getting mature is in our twenties. <br />
      We can, of course, still create new neurones and new connections after
      this age, but when our brain is developing, it can suck way more
      information than in any other stage. <br />
      We now know that the brain develops from bottom to top and from back to
      front. This order reflects the evolutionary age of the areas of the brain.
      The oldest parts of the brain—the ones also present in our ancient
      ancestors and animal cousins—develop first, at the base of the brain near
      the spine. They control breathing, senses, emotions, sex, pleasure, sleep,
      hunger and thirst, or the “animal propensities” left intact after Phineas
      Gage’s injury. Roughly speaking, these areas are what we consider to be
      the emotional brain. The most forward part of the brain—literally and
      figuratively—is the frontal lobe, located just behind the forehead. The
      most recent part of the brain to have evolved in humans, it is also the
      final area of the brain to mature in each individual. Nicknamed the
      “executive functioning center” and the “seat of civilization,” the frontal
      lobe is where reason and judgment reside.
      <br /><br />
      From MRI scans of healthy adolescents and twentysomethings, we now know
      that the frontal lobe does not fully mature until sometime between the
      ages of twenty and thirty. In our twenties, the pleasure-seeking,
      emotional brain is ready to go while the forward-thinking frontal lobe is
      still a work in progress. Twentysomethings aren’t brain damaged, of
      course, but because of the still-developing frontal lobe, they can be what
      psychologists call “uneven.” Many of my clients are confused by the fact
      that they went to good colleges, yet they don’t know how to start the
      careers they want. Or they don’t understand how they could have been
      valedictorians but are unable to make decisions about whom to date and
      why.
      <br /><br />
      As we age, we feel less like leaves and more like trees. We have roots
      that ground us and sturdy trunks that may sway, but don’t break, in the
      wind. The wind that blows by can be more serious. “You’re fired!” is much
      scarier when you have a mortgage. The things we do wrong at work are no
      longer typos but maybe losing a $500,000 account or releasing software
      that crashes the company website for a day. But older adults—and even
      twentysomethings who work at it—can be rooted in the confidence that
      problems can be solved, or at least survived.
    </p>
    <h3>Confidence:</h3>
    <p>
      Many young people feel without confidence, and they may think they are not
      good enough. Confidence does not come naturally, but it comes with
      experience. So it may be obvious why many young people do not have
      confidence as they lack the life experience which comes with age and
      deliberate practice!
      <br /><br />
      We should put ourself to a problematic situation as this is the only way
      to grow. For my standards, I was complaining quite a lot about hard times
      at work, while travelling, or at any other stressful situation. But after
      reading this book, I am grateful for all those situations. If things were
      easy, I might have built false confidence, and at some point, I would pay
      for it by not being prepared by tough situations.
      <br /><br />
      Inaction breeds fear and doubt. Action breeds confidence and courage. If
      you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and
      get busy. —Dale Carnegie, writer and lecturer.

    <h4>I would finish this summary by a short story of Meg Jay:</h4>
    <p>
      I saw the MOUNTAINS DON’T CARE sign when I was headed into the Rockies on
      a backpacking trip. Probably because the sign unnerved me, I stopped in at
      the backcountry office to clear my itinerary with the ranger. To get to
      the first valley where I would camp, I needed to walk some miles in and
      hike switchback up the scree of a mountain. Then I would cut diagonally
      across a steep snow slope to get to the saddle between two peaks. There I
      could pop over the ridge and down the other side before nightfall. This
      wasn’t especially dangerous, given that I was experienced and had the
      right gear. But I did need to get to the snow slope fast enough so I could
      cross it before too many hours of heat from the sun made it susceptible to
      slide. I knew the pace at which I needed to hike and the angle of the
      slope, but still I felt nervous. As I gathered up my maps and turned to
      go, I hesitated and asked the ranger, “Am I going to make it?” He looked
      at me and said, “You haven’t decided yet.” At the time, I thought this man
      was not a particularly good backcountry ranger. Now I have to laugh. He
      was telling me what I say to my twentysomething clients every day, what
      this book has been all about. The future isn’t written in the stars. There
      are no guarantees. So claim your adulthood. Be intentional. Get to work.
      Pick your family. Do the math. Make your own certainty. Don’t be defined
      by what you didn’t know or didn’t do. You are deciding your life right
      now.
      <br /><br />
      This book definitely made me think more on my every day decisions.
